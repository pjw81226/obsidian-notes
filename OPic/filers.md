예를들어 한국의 은행에 대해 설명해봐라
```
Most people in Korea use mobile banking instead of going to a physical bank. It's really convenient because you can transfer money to **others from** your bed.

That's why I don't know much about physical banks, but to answer your question, most Korean banks are located near subway stations.

I think it's for accessibility. Many elderly people still visit banks. If banks were in hard-to-reach places, it would be difficult for them to get there. So, overall, Korean banks are found near subway stations
